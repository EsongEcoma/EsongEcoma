Hi, I’m @EsongEcoma.
I’m interested in software and web development using JavaScript, C-sharp, and Python.
I have previously developed some simple desktop apps using Visual Basic and, very recently, C-sharp. I’m however very interested in improving my software development skills and I'm currently learning advanced features of JavaScript.
I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly opensource projects to help build my skills and learn best practices in software development.
